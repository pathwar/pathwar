# Pathwar

## Lightpaper v0

Pathwar is a platform for cyber security training.
Through a playful graphic universe, it allows users to learn step by step the basics of security, both offensive and defensive, and to become familiar with all forms of vulnerabilities.

Through its gamified approach, the platform allows a progressive rise in skills of the participants from a basic programming level to an expert level.
Composed of various challenges and themes, the platform aims to deliver the most complete training possible for all past, present and future security issues.

Whether they are employees of a company, students, freelancers, or young enthusiasts, users of the platform have a fun interface with an original design, giving access to increasingly complex challenges.

The platform is designed to be fed by the community itself and to be constantly evolving. A user who has won different levels and challenges can thus himself propose new challenges to the community and come to feed the training for the following users.

Once users have reached a high level on the platform, they will have access to different challenges submitted by companies on pathwar.
These challenges, accessible to a limited number of "high level" users, are comparable to a "bug bounty" campaign and sometimes entitle the participant who takes up the challenge to be remunerated.

The platform regularly offers new "episodes", taking the form of new challenges linked to an ephemeral event. Thus new "islands" appear regularly on the map and are open to users according to their level.
For example, a company may have an island dedicated to its challenges, for a given period, or on a permanent basis within the map.
