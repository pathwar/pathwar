    <h2>_('Basics')</h2>
    <p>_('HTTP itself is a stateless protocol (meaning that each request is independent), which is problematic for most web applications, as they need to keep track of users' sessions â€“ for example, whether the user is logged in, and what products they've added to their shopping cart.')
        _('To bypass this limitations, HTTP cookies were created.')</p>
            <h2>How HTTP cookies work</h2>
            <p>A cookie is typically set by the server by sending a <b>Set-Cookie</b> header to the client (per cookie).
            A response that set cookies looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: bar=42; Path=/; Domain=.foo.com
Set-Cookie: session=12345; HTTPOnly
...            
</pre>
           
    <p>_('Cookies are automatically sent by the client with the header 'Cookie' containing all the valid cookies for the current domain, separated by a semicolon. (You will have the occasion to study this behaviour later in some levels :)). Using the above example, any subsequent request to foo.com will include the two cookies set by the server:')</p>
<pre class="code">
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.com
Cookie: bar=42; session=12345

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
</pre>
