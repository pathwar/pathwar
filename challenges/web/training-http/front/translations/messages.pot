msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid "HTTP is a client-server protocol commonly used by web browsers (or HTTP clients) and web servers to communicate."
msgstr ""

msgid "This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of the protocol (methods, headers, and modifications)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once done, go check the RFCs 1945, and 7230 to 7235 (and a few others) for an in-depth explanation of the protocol. If you don't know how to find an RFC, google is your friend."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTTP offers multiple methods (with some extensions, like WebDAV, but you won't see them much)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The five most used are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Get a resource specified by the request URI. Parameters can be passed in the query string"
msgstr ""

msgid "Send data to a server (for example, the content of a form). Parameters are passed in the body of the requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Used to create a resource at the requested URI. Data is passed inside the body of the request."
msgstr ""

msgid "The opposite of PUT. Used to delete the resource at the request URI."
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrieve only the response headers, without the body."
msgstr ""

msgid "Challenge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Request Headers"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a client send a request to a server, it can send headers to give more information about the request (e.g. languages supported by the client, hostname of the requested website, stored cookies)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can easily change the request headers sent by your browser with the help of an extension or a proxy that intercepts the requests it makes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Response Headers"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a web server sends a response to a client, it can send along a few response headers, containing information about the response (like its size), or instructions for the browser, e.g. if, or for how long, it should cache the page."
msgstr ""

msgid "This page has sent you a custom header containing a passphrase. See if you can find it! (Tip: You can use the debug console of your browser.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "As seen previously, web servers can send HTTP headers to the client."
msgstr ""

msgid "A commonly used header is"
msgstr ""

msgid "This header is used to redirect the client to another page or website (for example, to redirect the user to their profile page on succesful login)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following link will send your browser an HTTP redirection to this page that will automatically be followed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Redirection"
msgstr ""

msgid "HTTP clients are not required to follow redirections. For example, curl does not follow them by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try requesting the redirection page with curl to get the passphrase."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basics"
msgstr ""

msgid "HTTP itself is a stateless protocol (meaning that each request is independent), which is problematic for most web applications, as they need to keep track of users' sessions â€“ for example, whether the user is logged in, and what products they've added to their shopping cart."
msgstr ""

msgid "To bypass this limitations, HTTP cookies were created."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cookies are automatically sent by the client with the header 'Cookie' containing all the valid cookies for the current domain, separated by a semicolon. (You will have the occasion to study this behaviour later in some levels :)). Using the above example, any subsequent request to foo.com will include the two cookies set by the server:"

msgid "Cookies Manipulation"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you opened this page for the first time, the server sent a cookie named"
msgstr ""

msgid "to your browser"
msgstr ""

msgid "As cookie are stored client-side, you can easily modify or delete them."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is a lots of way to do this, but the simplest is to use a browser extensions (for Chrome or Chromium, you can use EditThisCookie, for other browsers, check"
