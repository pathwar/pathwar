# Get Started

Make sure you have Node.js 8+.

1. **Run the install script**

    `npm install`

2. **Run start to see in dev mode with browsersync server**

    `npm start -s`
    
     Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

3. **Run build script to see a live prod with browsersync server**

    `npm run build`
    
     Note: Generates the /dist folder. This will start a server with files from de build final artifacts in /dist folder too.
